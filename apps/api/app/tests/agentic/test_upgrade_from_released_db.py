"""Upgrading an EXISTING database, not building a fresh one.

Every other migration test in this suite creates an empty database and runs the
whole chain, which is the one scenario where an edited-in-place revision still
works: it has never been applied, so the edit takes effect. A real deployment is
the opposite — most revisions are already recorded, and Alembic will never re-run
them no matter what their file now says.

That gap shipped a real outage. 0043 was released without the consent-provenance
columns and they were added to it afterwards, so a running instance stamped at
0048 reported those columns as applied while `agent_approvals` did not have them,
and the first step the worker executed raised
`column agent_approvals.invalidated_from does not exist`.

So this walks the chain the way a deployment does: stop at an intermediate
revision, then upgrade the rest of the way, and require that every column the ORM
maps actually exists afterwards. An edited revision earlier than the stopping
point cannot rescue itself, which is precisely the failure mode.
