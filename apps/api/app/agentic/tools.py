"""First-party NUR tool contracts.

This module is the join between the abstract risk classes the policy engine
reasons about and the real capabilities NUR has. It declares *contracts* — key,
version, risk class, required capabilities, idempotency and cost. Handlers are
bound separately in `registry.py`, and a contract without a bound handler is
never callable; the registry refuses to resolve it rather than returning
something empty that a planner would treat as success.

Two deliberate absences, both load-bearing:

There is no tool here for shell, filesystem, network, repository writes,
messaging, publish, deploy, payments, booking, security changes or secret
access. Not disabled — absent. A denied-but-present tool is one config edit away
from being live; a tool that does not exist has to be written, reviewed and
merged. The existing AM Projects capability catalog already denies these, and
this registry does not reintroduce them by the back door.

There is no `write_memory`. `create_memory_candidate` proposes; nothing here
promotes a candidate to owner truth. Model output never becomes OWNER_WRITTEN,
so the tool that would do it is not offered to a model.
