"""Read-only tool handlers, bound to the services that already exist.

Every handler here delegates to the same function the HTTP route uses. That
import direction — agentic reaching into `api.v1` — is not the tidiest layering,
and it is deliberate. The alternative is a second implementation of the same
query, and a second implementation drifts from the first silently: the route and
the tool would answer the same question differently, and nothing would fail.
Sharing one function makes drift impossible rather than merely unlikely.

Only R0 tools are bound in this module. Every handler takes an already
RLS-scoped session and an owner id and returns plain data. None of them writes,
which is asserted structurally by the tests rather than promised here.

Tools without a handler stay unbound on purpose. `registry.handler` raises
`UnboundToolError` for those, so an unimplemented tool fails loudly instead of
returning an empty result a planner would treat as a completed step.

# without proof that this exact call was approved.

# already checks it. Re-checking inside the handler is deliberate duplication:
# a guard that lives only in the caller is one refactor away from being skipped,
# and the thing it protects is a mutation of someone's record. Defence in depth
# is cheap here and the failure it prevents is not recoverable by an apology.
