"""Tool resolution. Refuses rather than improvises.

A registry that returns something plausible for an unknown key is worse than one
that raises, because a planner will treat an empty result as a successful step
and build the rest of the plan on it. Every failure mode here is loud.

Handler binding is separate from contract declaration on purpose. A contract can
exist — so the policy engine and the approval card can reason about it — while
its handler is still unimplemented, and calling it fails with a specific error
instead of silently doing nothing.
