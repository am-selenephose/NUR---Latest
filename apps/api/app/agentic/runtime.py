"""The execution loop: what turns a compiled plan into work that happened.

Everything this calls already exists and is tested in isolation — the claim, the
policy gate, the tool registry, the approval check, the event ledger, the
dependant unlock. The runtime is what makes them one loop, and the ordering is
the whole design:

    claim → policy → approval → execute → record → verify → unlock

Two orderings are non-negotiable.

Policy and approval are evaluated *after* the claim and *before* the handler. A
gate checked before claiming would let two workers both pass it; a gate checked
after execution is not a gate. The claim is what gives one worker the exclusive
right to ask the question at all.

The result is recorded before verification, not after. A step that crashed
during verification must not look like a step that never ran — the work already
happened, and an audit trail that omits it because a later stage failed is a
trail that lies by omission.

Provider-backed agent execution is deliberately absent. This loop runs
deterministic first-party tools only. Adding a model call here without the
guardrails, budget accounting and checkpointing that a bounded agent run needs
would be the kind of shortcut that makes an agentic layer look finished while
being unsafe.
