"""Confirmation gates for Omega v1 claim extraction.

The rule is intentionally conservative: model-shaped or sensitive inferred
claims wait for the owner. This prevents the research layer from quietly
turning guesses about health, identity, beliefs, relationships, or private
state into stored facts.
