/**
 * The canonical content host that Orbit, Map and Timeline mount into.
 *
 * Founder decision: the checkpoint UI stays. The left rail, the top nav
 * (UNIVERSE · MAP · ORBITS · TIMELINE · INSIGHTS), the starfield and the
 * star-brain are the product's identity, and a surface belongs *inside* that
 * shell rather than on top of it. This module is what makes that true.
 *
 * The canonical structure, confirmed against the live document:
 *
 *   #nur-front-v61 .nur-shell
 *     ASIDE.nur-rail          the left rail            (kept, untouched)
 *     MAIN.nur-main
 *       HEADER.nur-topbar     the world nav            (kept, untouched)
 *       SECTION.nur-viewport  the content region       (the host lives here)
 *         SECTION.nur-page    the canonical page       (hidden while mounted)
 *
 * Two earlier attempts were wrong and are recorded here so they are not
 * repeated. First, each surface painted an opaque `#000000` on a `position:
 * fixed` root at z-index 320: that covered `#space3d` — the galaxy canvas at 280
 * — and NUR lost its stars entirely. Second, making that root translucent
 * brought the stars back but also the canonical page beneath it, so two
 * interfaces rendered at once.
 *
 * Mounting inside the shell fixes both at the root. `#nur-front-v61` sits at
 * z-index 10, *below* the galaxy, and `#space3d` blends with `mix-blend-mode:
 * screen` — which only ever lightens. So canonical content and anything hosted
 * beside it receive the starfield painted over them, which is precisely how the
 * canonical page gets its stars. A surface in here needs no scrim and no
 * stacking tricks: it inherits the real thing.
 *
 * Nothing canonical is edited. One class and one appended child, both removed on
 * the way out, so `check-v197-integrity.sh` is unaffected.
