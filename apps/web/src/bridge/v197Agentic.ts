/**
 * V197 agency surfaces: the drawer, the approval inbox, and run detail.
 *
 * The product law this implements is that agency is never invisible. If NUR is
 * doing something, it appears here; if NUR wants permission, it appears here
 * with enough detail to actually decide. Hiding either behind a server log
 * would make the whole approval mechanism decorative — an owner cannot withhold
 * consent they were never asked for.
 *
 * Two constraints carried over from the lens work, both learned the hard way:
 *
 *   No second rAF. Canonical already runs the galaxy loop; a drawer that
 *   animates on its own frame budget competes with the thing that makes the
 *   product feel alive. Everything here is event-driven and CSS-transitioned.
 *
 *   Real elements, never canonical's pseudo-elements. Painting on ::before or
 *   ::after of a canonical control silently destroys an existing effect. The
 *   drawer is appended DOM with its own classes.
